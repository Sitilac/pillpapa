# Pill Papa - "The papa who constantly reminds you to take your pills"
### Pill Papa's mission is to provide an easy way to keep track of all your daily medicinal intake and make doing so as fun as possible (due to gamification).
### This app was created out of necessity. 55% of Americans regularly take a prescription medicine and a rising number of them are getting sick from improper drug consumption due to either not being consistent with when and/or what they consume. About 400 people die of such errors in a 13-year study done. These preventable mistakes could also cause severe financial, psychological, and emotional stress to the healthcare provider and organization. Quite frankly, pill tracker options exist but with price-tags that might turn some people away.
### The solution to the problems highlighted above is a simple, enjoyable, and free pill tracker -- in other words, Pill Papa!

## Next Steps:
* We have a lot of ideas we we not able to implement due to time constraints so we will definetely come back to the project to implement image text scraper capabilities, finalize the gamification of the app, sorting the patient index page, adding a Facilities model to add further functionality to groups and adminoversight, and finalize the notifications for admins and patients to increase the productivity of the app.
* There was a lot of styling that was done as well but when resizing on smaller screens it was noticed that certain things were not as responsive as one originally believed them to be. We will come back to optimize the user experience with better styling.
